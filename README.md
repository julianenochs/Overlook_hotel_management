# Ophelias Hotel Management: Overview

Ophelias Hotel Management is an app that allows a hotel manager to effectively navigate the innerworkings of Ophelias guests, bookings, and room services offerings. Laid out in a simple to use format, the user is able to:
  - Search and Add Guests
  - See Metrics for All Ophelias Bookings and Room Services
  - See Metrics for All Guests pertaining to bookings and room services

## Technical Overview

This application utilizes the following technologies
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript
  - jQuery
  - Mocha & Chai 

## Future Iterations

Features that I plan on adding in future iterations: 
  - Allow a manager to book room services for a guest
  - Allow a manager to unbook a room
  - Allow a manager to upgrade a room
